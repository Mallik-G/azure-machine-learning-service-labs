# Lab 0: Setting up your environment 

If a lab environmnet has not be provided for you, this lab provides the instructions to get started in your own Azure Subscription.

The following summarizes the lab requirements if you want to setup your own environment (for example, on your local machine). If this is your first time peforming these labs, it is highly recommended you follow the Quick Start instructions below rather that setup your own environment from scratch.

The labs have the following requirements:
- Azure subscription. You will need a valid and active Azure account to complete this Azure lab. If you do not have one, you can sign up for a [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).
- One of the following environments:
    - Visual Studio 2017 and the Visual Studio Tools for AI 
    - Visual Studio Code
    - PyCharm
    - Azure Databricks Workspace
    - Azure Notebooks
- For the deep learning lab, you will need a VM or cluster with GPU capabilities.

Depending on which environment you use, there are different requirements. These are summarized as follows:
- Visual Studio 2017, Visual Studio Code and PyCharm
    - A Python 3.x Anaconda environment named `azureml` with:
        - The latest version of the Azure Machine Learning Python SDK installed. Use `pip install --upgrade azureml-sdk[notebooks,automl] azureml-dataprep` to install the latest version.
        - The following pip installable packages:
            - numpy, pandas, scikitlearn, keras and tensorflow-gpu 
    - For the deep learning lab, make sure you have your GPU drivers properly installed.
- Azure Databricks
    - An Azure Databricks Workspace
    - A two-node Azure Databricks cluster with the following Python libraries attached:
            - numpy, pandas, scikitlearn, keras and tensorflow-gpu

The following sections describe the setup process for each environment.

# Quickstart: Visual Studio 2017 and PyCharm
The quickest way to get going with the labs is to deploy the Deep Learning Virtual Machine (DLVM). 

1. Follow these instructions for [creating an Deep Learning Virtual Machine](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/provision-deep-learning-dsvm). Be sure you do the following:
    - OS Type: Select Windows 2016
    - Location: Choose a region that provides NC series VM's, such as East US, East US 2, North Central US, South Central US and West US 2. Be sure to visit the [Azure Products by Region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/services/) website for the latest.
    - Virtual Machine size: NC6
2. Once the VM is ready, download the remote desktop (RDP) file from the Overview blade of your VM in the Azure Portal and login. If you are unfamiliar with this process, see [Connect to a VM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/connect-logon).
3. Once you are connected to your DLVM, open the Start Menu and run `Anaconda Prompt`. 
4. Activate the azureml conda environment by running `activate azureml`.
5. To ensure tensorflow uses a GPU, you will need to uninstall and reinstall Keras and Tensorflow in a specific order. Run these commands in sequence:
    - `pip uninstall keras`
    - `pip uninstall tensorflow-gpu`
    - `pip uninstall tensorflow`
    - `pip install keras`
    - `pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.10.0`
 6. Upgrade the installed version of the Azure Machine Learning SDK by running the following command:
    - `pip install --upgrade azureml-sdk[notebooks,automl] azureml-dataprep`
7. If you will be using Visual Studio for the labs, launch `Visual Studio 2017` from the Start menu and login with your Microsoft Account. Allow Visual Studio a few moments to get ready. Once you see the Tools for AI Start Page displayed in Visual Studio, the setup is complete.
8. If you will be using PyCharm for the labs, launch `JetBrains PyCharm Community Edition` from the Start menu. On the Complete Installation dialog, leave `Do not import settings` selected, accept the license agreement and choose an option for Data Sharing. On the Customize PyCharm screen, select `Skip Remaining and Set Defaults`. Once you are at the Welcome to PyCharm new project dialog the setup is complete.
9. Your Virtual Machine is now ready to support any of the labs using either the Visual Studio or PyCharm environments.     


# Quickstart: Azure Databricks

1. Click the following button to open the ARM template in the Azure Portal.
[Deploy Databricks from the ARM Template](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Fazure-quickstart-templates%2Fmaster%2F101-databricks-workspace%2Fazuredeploy.json)

2. Provide the required values to create your Azure Databricks workspace:
    - Subscription: Choose the Azure Subscription in which to deploy the workspace.
    - Resource Group: Leave at Create new and provide a name for the new resource group.
    - Location: Select a location near you for deployment that supports both Azure Databricks AND provides NC series GPU enabled Virtual Machines. This currently includes East US, East US 2, North Central US, South Central US and West US 2. For the latest list, see [Azure services available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/services/).
    - Workspace Name: Provide a name for your workspace.
    - Pricing Tier: Ensure `premium` is selected.

3. Accept the terms and conditions.
4. Select Purchase. 
5. The workspace creation takes a few minutes. During workspace creation, the portal displays the Submitting deployment for Azure Databricks tile on the right side. You may need to scroll right on your dashboard to see the tile. There is also a progress bar displayed near the top of the screen. You can watch either area for progress.

# Quickstart: Azure Notebooks

1. Please follow the steps outlined in [Azure Notebooks Setup Page](./azure-notebooks-setup) before continuing. 

2. Once the setup is done, you can then follow the steps as outlined for each of labs.

# Quickstart: Jupyter Notebooks

1. From starter-artifacts navigate to the [python-notebooks](../starter-artifacts/python-notebooks) and download the project files to your local computer. Also remember to maintain the folder structure within each of the labs. For example for `lab-1`, the root folder is `01-model-training` and the folder contains the starting python file `01-model-training.ipynb` and it has two subfolders called `data` for the data files and `training` for the training files. 

2. Install the latest version of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).

3. Setup a new conda environment for Azure Auto ML. The easiest way to do that is to download the automl_setup script for your machine (Windows-automl_setup.cmd, Linux-automl_setup_linux.sh, Mac-automl_setup_mac.sh) and the common automl_env.yml file from the following [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/tree/master/how-to-use-azureml/automated-machine-learning). Open command prompt or terminal and go to the directory where the two files are saved and run the script file. The script will creates a new conda environment called `azure_automl`, and installs the necessary packages.


# Quickstart: Visual Studio Code

1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview) on your machine.

2. Install the latest version of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).

3. Setup a new conda environment for Azure Auto ML. The easiest way to do that is to download the automl_setup script for your machine (Windows-automl_setup.cmd, Linux-automl_setup_linux.sh, Mac-automl_setup_mac.sh) and the common automl_env.yml file from the following [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/tree/master/how-to-use-azureml/automated-machine-learning). Open the Anaconda command prompt and go to the directory where the two files are saved and run the script file. The script will creates a new conda environment called `azure_automl`, and installs the necessary packages.

4. From starter-artifacts navigate to the [visual-studio-code](../starter-artifacts/visual-studio-code) and download the project files to your local computer. Also remember to maintain the folder structure within each of the labs. For example for `lab-1`, the root folder is `01-model-training` and the folder contains the starting python file `01-model-training.py` and it has two subfolders called `data` for the data files and `training` for the training files. 

5. When you are ready to start a lab: (1) start Visual Stuido Code, (2) go to File->Open Menu, and (3) open the **folder** for the lab. For example, to work on `lab-1`, open the folder `01-model-training` from Visual Studio Code. This will ensure that the current working directory for the quickstart’s starting python file will set correctly. 

7. In VS code, when you first open the starting python file for a lab, use Select Interpreter command from the Command Palette (⇧⌘P) and select the azure_automl as your interpreter.

8. Next, follow the steps as outlined for each of labs.
